Designing a database schema for an Instagram-like platform requires thoughtful planning, as it involves many features like user management, posts, comments, likes, followers, and interactions. Below is an outline of the database schema and the APIs needed for such a platform.

### 1. **Database Schema Design**

We’ll focus on essential tables, relationships, and relevant fields required for the platform.

### 2. **API Endpoints**

These API endpoints will allow users to interact with the platform.

#### **User Authentication**
- **POST /api/register** — Register a new user.
- **POST /api/login** — User login (returns JWT token).

- **POST /api/forgot-password** — Send reset password link.
- **POST /api/reset-password** — Reset the password using token.

#### **User Profile**
- **GET /api/user/{user_id}** — Get user profile details.
- **PUT /api/user/{user_id}** — Update user profile (profile picture, bio).
- **GET /api/user/{user_id}/followers** — Get a list of followers of the user.
- **GET /api/user/{user_id}/following** — Get a list of users the user is following.
- **POST /api/user/follow/{user_id}** — Follow a user.
- **POST /api/user/unfollow/{user_id}** — Unfollow a user.

#### **Tags**
- **GET /api/tags** — Get a list of all tags.
- **GET /api/tags/{tag_name}/posts** — Get all posts associated with a specific tag.

---

### 3. **API Design Considerations**

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs like search, follow/unfollow, and like/unlike with rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination on endpoints that return lists of data (e.g., posts, comments, followers).
- **Data Validation**: Use input validation on all fields, ensuring they meet the expected format (e.g., valid email format, image URL, etc.).
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data like popular posts or trending tags.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive information, including passwords, using industry-standard algorithms like bcrypt.

### Get like count for a post

When dealing with a post that has millions of likes, retrieving the like count efficiently becomes important for performance. To ensure that you can retrieve the like count in a performant way without directly counting every like every time, here are a few strategies you can use:

### 1. **Use a Cached Count (Optimized Storage)**
One of the most efficient ways to handle this is to maintain a **like count** in a separate table or as an attribute within the `Posts` table itself. Instead of querying the entire `Likes` table every time you need to know the like count, you update this cached value only when a user likes or unlikes the post.

#### **Table Design with Cached Count**

You can add a `like_count` column to the `Posts` table to store the number of likes:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Posts
ADD COLUMN like_count INT DEFAULT 0;
```

This column will store the current like count for each post.

#### **API Logic**
- **Incrementing the like count**: When a user likes a post, increment the `like_count` field in the `Posts` table.
- **Decrementing the like count**: When a user unlikes a post, decrement the `like_count` field.

#### **SQL Queries for Incrementing and Decrementing**
1. **Like a post** (Increment the like count):
   ```sql
   UPDATE Posts
   SET like_count = like_count + 1
   WHERE post_id = {post_id};
   ```

2. **Unlike a post** (Decrement the like count):
   ```sql
   UPDATE Posts
   SET like_count = like_count - 1
   WHERE post_id = {post_id};
   ```

3. **Get the like count for a post**:
   ```sql
   SELECT like_count
   FROM Posts
   WHERE post_id = {post_id};
   ```

### 2. **Using a Counter Service with Eventual Consistency**

In systems where the like count needs to be highly scalable (e.g., millions of likes), another option is to use a **distributed counter** or **eventual consistency** approach. This can be achieved using caching systems like Redis, where you can use atomic operations to increment and retrieve the like count.

#### **Redis Approach**

You can use Redis to store the like count and increment it atomically. Redis provides an efficient way to handle counters without locking or affecting database performance.

1. **Increment the Like Count**:
   ```python
   import redis

   r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
   post_id = "post:12345"  # Example post ID
   r.incr(post_id)  # Increments the like count by 1
   ```

2. **Get the Like Count**:
   ```python
   like_count = r.get(post_id)  # Retrieves the like count
   if like_count is None:
       like_count = 0  # If the post has no likes, initialize to 0
   ```

3. **Ensure Eventual Consistency**:  
   In some cases, you might want to periodically synchronize the Redis counter with your primary database (e.g., at regular intervals or during off-peak hours). This ensures that the count in Redis doesn’t drift too far from the actual database value.

   **Synchronizing with Database**:
   - When the like count reaches a threshold or after a set period, batch update the main `Posts` table with the like count stored in Redis.

### 3. **Sharding for Even Larger Scales**

If the number of likes for a post is exceptionally large (millions), you can consider sharding or partitioning the `Likes` table across multiple database nodes. This approach ensures that querying likes doesn't overload any single database server.

For example:
- **Sharding**: Split the `Likes` table into multiple partitions based on certain criteria, such as ranges of post IDs or geographical locations. This reduces the load on a single server when querying like counts.

### 4. **Pre-aggregated Likes in a Separate Table**

Another approach to prevent excessive querying of millions of likes is to maintain an **aggregated like count** in a separate table that updates periodically (e.g., using a cron job or a background process).

#### **Likes Aggregate Table**

You can create a table that stores the aggregated like counts for posts. The application can then query this table for the like count rather than the `Likes` table itself.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Post_Like_Aggregates (
    post_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    like_count INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

This table can be updated through an automated process:
- **Incremental Updates**: When a new like is added, update the `Post_Like_Aggregates` table in a batch process (perhaps every few minutes).
- **Real-Time Updates**: If a post receives an exceptionally high number of likes, you can update the like count in real-time, using a background process.

---

### 5. **API Endpoint to Get Like Count for a Post**
Once you have a mechanism to efficiently store and retrieve the like count, the corresponding API endpoint to fetch the like count would look like this:

#### **GET /api/posts/{post_id}/like_count**

- **Description**: Fetch the like count for a post.
- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "post_id": 12345,
    "like_count": 5000000
  }
  ```

- **Implementation**:  
  Depending on your system design (Redis, cached database, etc.), the server would return the like count in response to the user request.

---

### Summary
- For a post with millions of likes, it's crucial to **cache the like count** (either in the database or using a distributed system like Redis).
- You can **increment and decrement** the like count in the `Posts` table when a user likes or unlikes a post.
- For extremely large numbers of likes, you may need to use **sharding**, **eventual consistency**, or a **background process** to aggregate and sync the like counts.

To implement an API endpoint for fetching posts for a feed on scroll, along with their like and comment counts, you will need a combination of pagination, efficient counting for likes and comments, and optimizing data retrieval to handle large datasets (especially with millions of posts, likes, and comments).

Below, I’ll outline how to design the system to fetch posts efficiently, including like and comment counts, when a user scrolls through the feed.

### Key Features of the Feed:
1. **Pagination**: Use pagination (often in combination with offset/limit or cursor-based pagination) to fetch a subset of posts at a time.
2. **Efficient Like and Comment Count**: Calculate the like and comment counts efficiently, ideally without querying every like and comment each time.
3. **Caching**: To prevent unnecessary database load, you can cache the like and comment counts.

### Database Schema Assumptions

You have the following tables:

1. **Posts**: Stores the posts.
2. **Likes**: Stores likes for posts.
3. **Comments**: Stores comments for posts.

Here’s a quick summary of these tables:
- `Posts`: Contains the posts (`post_id`, `user_id`, `caption`, `image_url`, `created_at`).
- `Likes`: Tracks likes for posts (`post_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`).
- `Comments`: Stores comments for posts (`comment_id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `comment_text`, `created_at`).

We will also assume you have a `like_count` and `comment_count` in the `Posts` table or some caching mechanism to avoid recalculating these counts on every scroll.

### 1. **Caching Like and Comment Counts in the `Posts` Table (Optional but Recommended)**
To improve performance, maintain a **cached count** for both likes and comments in the `Posts` table. This helps reduce the number of queries to the `Likes` and `Comments` tables.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Posts
ADD COLUMN like_count INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN comment_count INT DEFAULT 0;
```

Whenever a like or comment is added or removed, you update these counts in the `Posts` table. This approach reduces the need for querying large datasets to count likes and comments on every scroll.

### 2. **Pagination for the Feed**
For efficient pagination, we use **cursor-based pagination**. This ensures that each scroll fetches the next set of posts based on a unique identifier (e.g., `post_id` or `created_at`) and avoids issues with offsets when data changes.

#### Cursor-based Pagination Query:
Let's say you're showing posts sorted by their `created_at` or `post_id`, and you fetch posts starting from a certain point.

```sql
SELECT post_id, user_id, caption, image_url, created_at, like_count, comment_count
FROM Posts
WHERE created_at <= {last_seen_post_created_at}
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

This query fetches the next 20 posts (or whatever the desired page size is) based on the `created_at` timestamp or `post_id`.

- **{last_seen_post_created_at}**: This is the timestamp of the last post from the previous page (for pagination).
- **ORDER BY created_at DESC**: Ensures posts are displayed in descending order by their creation date.

If you prefer using `post_id` instead of `created_at` for sorting:

```sql
SELECT post_id, user_id, caption, image_url, created_at, like_count, comment_count
FROM Posts
WHERE post_id < {last_seen_post_id}
ORDER BY post_id DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. **API Endpoint Design**

#### **GET /api/feed**
- **Description**: Fetch posts for the user's feed on scroll, along with the like and comment counts.
- **Request Parameters**:
  - `last_seen_post_id`: The `post_id` of the last post the user saw (for pagination).
  - `limit`: The number of posts to return per request (default can be 20).
- **Response**:
  - A list of posts with their `like_count` and `comment_count`.

#### API Example:

##### **Request**:
```http
GET /api/feed?last_seen_post_id=123456&limit=20
```

##### **Response** (JSON):
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "post_id": 123457,
      "user_id": 10,
      "caption": "Beautiful sunset!",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/images/post1.jpg",
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:15:30Z",
      "like_count": 1200,
      "comment_count": 300
    },
    {
      "post_id": 123458,
      "user_id": 15,
      "caption": "Had a great time at the beach!",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/images/post2.jpg",
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T09:50:00Z",
      "like_count": 2500,
      "comment_count": 450
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Handling Like and Comment Counts**

#### **Efficient Count Retrieval for Posts**:
To handle the like and comment counts without querying the entire `Likes` and `Comments` tables each time, use the following strategies:

- **Cached Count**: If you're storing the like and comment counts in the `Posts` table (as mentioned earlier), simply fetch these values directly from the `Posts` table in the pagination query.
- **Incrementing/Decrementing Counts**: Whenever a user likes or unlikes a post, or adds/removes a comment, update the respective `like_count` and `comment_count` fields in the `Posts` table.
  
#### **Updating Counts on Like/Comment Action**:
For example:
- When a user likes a post:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Likes (post_id, user_id, created_at) VALUES ({post_id}, {user_id}, NOW());
  UPDATE Posts SET like_count = like_count + 1 WHERE post_id = {post_id};
  ```

- When a user unlikes a post:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Likes WHERE post_id = {post_id} AND user_id = {user_id};
  UPDATE Posts SET like_count = like_count - 1 WHERE post_id = {post_id};
  ```

- When a user adds a comment:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Comments (post_id, user_id, comment_text, created_at) VALUES ({post_id}, {user_id}, {comment_text}, NOW());
  UPDATE Posts SET comment_count = comment_count + 1 WHERE post_id = {post_id};
  ```

### 5. **Rate Limiting and Caching**

To avoid excessive database hits for counting likes and comments, implement **caching** for frequent queries. You can use a caching layer like Redis for the like and comment counts, and invalidate/recalculate these values periodically or when a like/comment is added/removed.

---

### Summary

- **Pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination to efficiently load posts for the feed.
- **Like and Comment Counts**: Maintain counts in the `Posts` table for quick access.
- **API Endpoint**: Implement a `GET /api/feed` endpoint that returns a list of posts with the like and comment counts.
- **Efficient Counting**: Increment/decrement the like and comment counts in the `Posts` table when a like or comment is added or removed.
- **Caching**: Consider caching like and comment counts using Redis for scalability.

This approach should help in efficiently delivering posts with their like and comment counts as users scroll through the feed.

Direct messaging (DM) in a social media application like Instagram allows users to send and receive text and media messages (images, videos, etc.) privately. Designing a system for DMs requires considering the following aspects:

1. **Database Schema for DMs**: 
   - Storing messages.
   - Storing media (images/videos).
   - Efficiently fetching messages.

2. **APIs for Sending/Receiving Text and Media Messages**: 
   - Text message sending.
   - Media message sending.
   - Message retrieval.

3. **Handling Notifications**: 
   - Notifying users when they receive a new message.

### 1. **Database Schema Design for Direct Messages**

To handle Direct Messages (DMs) effectively, we need to design a schema that can store both text and media messages. This schema will also support efficient retrieval of messages, as well as maintain the relationships between users.

#### Tables:

1. **Users**:
   This table stores user data (`user_id`, `username`, `email`, etc.).

2. **Conversations**:
   This table represents a conversation between two or more users.
   - `conversation_id` (PK) — Unique ID for the conversation.
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — The time when the conversation started.
   - `updated_at` (timestamp) — The time when the conversation was last updated.
   - `is_active` (boolean) — Whether the conversation is still active (if all messages are deleted, set to inactive).

3. **Conversation_Participants**:
   This table stores the participants in a conversation.
   - `conversation_id` (FK) — ID of the conversation.
   - `user_id` (FK) — ID of the user participating in the conversation.
   - `is_read` (boolean) — Whether the user has read the latest message.

4. **Messages**:
   This table stores the messages within a conversation (both text and media).
   - `message_id` (PK) — Unique ID for each message.
   - `conversation_id` (FK) — The conversation to which the message belongs.
   - `sender_id` (FK to Users.user_id) — The user who sent the message.
   - `message_type` (enum: `text`, `image`, `video`, etc.) — Type of message.
   - `message_content` (text) — The actual content of the message (text, URL of media file, etc.).
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — Timestamp of when the message was sent.
   - `is_read` (boolean) — Whether the recipient has read the message.

5. **Media**:
   This table stores media files (if a message contains an image or video).
   - `media_id` (PK) — Unique media ID.
   - `message_id` (FK to Messages.message_id) — The message associated with the media.
   - `media_type` (enum: `image`, `video`) — Type of media.
   - `file_url` (varchar) — URL pointing to the media file (e.g., stored in cloud storage like AWS S3).
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — Timestamp when the media was uploaded.

#### Example Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Conversations (
    conversation_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

CREATE TABLE Conversation_Participants (
    conversation_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES Conversations(conversation_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Messages (
    message_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_id INT,
    sender_id INT,
    message_type ENUM('text', 'image', 'video'),
    message_content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (conversation_id) REFERENCES Conversations(conversation_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Media (
    media_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    message_id INT,
    media_type ENUM('image', 'video'),
    file_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (message_id) REFERENCES Messages(message_id)
);
```

### 2. **API Endpoints for Sending/Receiving Text and Media Messages**

#### **Send Text Message**

- **POST /api/messages/send_text**
  - **Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "conversation_id": 123,
      "sender_id": 1,
      "message_content": "Hello, how are you?",
      "message_type": "text"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message_id": 456,
      "conversation_id": 123,
      "sender_id": 1,
      "message_content": "Hello, how are you?",
      "message_type": "text",
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:15:30Z",
      "is_read": false
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Create a new `Message` record in the `Messages` table with `message_type = 'text'`.
  - Update the `updated_at` field in the `Conversations` table.
  - Notify the recipient (either via push notification or internal system).

#### **Send Media Message (Image/Video)**

- **POST /api/messages/send_media**
  - **Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "conversation_id": 123,
      "sender_id": 1,
      "message_type": "image",
      "media_url": "https://example.com/media/image.jpg"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message_id": 457,
      "conversation_id": 123,
      "sender_id": 1,
      "message_content": "https://example.com/media/image.jpg",
      "message_type": "image",
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:20:00Z",
      "is_read": false
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - First, store the media file (image or video) on cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
  - Create a new `Message` record with the `message_type = 'image'` (or `video`).
  - Create an associated `Media` record linking to the media URL and the corresponding message.
  - Update the conversation's `updated_at` field and notify the recipient.

#### **Get Messages for a Conversation**

- **GET /api/messages/{conversation_id}**
  - **Request**:
    ```http
    GET /api/messages/123
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "conversation_id": 123,
      "messages": [
        {
          "message_id": 456,
          "sender_id": 1,
          "message_type": "text",
          "message_content": "Hello, how are you?",
          "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:15:30Z",
          "is_read": false
        },
        {
          "message_id": 457,
          "sender_id": 2,
          "message_type": "image",
          "message_content": "https://example.com/media/image.jpg",
          "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:20:00Z",
          "is_read": false
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Fetch all messages for the given `conversation_id` from the `Messages` table.
  - Fetch associated media from the `Media` table (if any).

#### **Mark Message as Read**

- **POST /api/messages/mark_as_read**
  - **Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "message_id": 456,
      "user_id": 1
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message_id": 456,
      "is_read": true
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Mark the `is_read` field as `true` for the specified `message_id` in the `Messages` table.

---

### 3. **Notification System**

You can implement notifications to alert users when they receive a new message. The notification can be sent when a new message is inserted into the `Messages` table or when the recipient has not read the message.

- **Push Notification**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a similar service to send push notifications to users when they receive a new message.
- **In-app Notifications**: Display notifications within the app interface.

---

### 4. **Example Flow for Sending a Media Message**

1. **User A sends a text message**: 
   - User A sends a text message to User B via the `/api/messages/send_text` endpoint.
   - The system creates the message in the `Messages` table and notifies User B.

2. **User A sends a media message**:
   - User A uploads an image through the app, which is then stored in a cloud storage service.
   - The app calls the `/api/messages/send_media` endpoint with the URL of the image.
   - The system stores the media URL in the `Media` table and creates a corresponding message in the `Messages` table.

3. **User B reads the message**:
   - User B fetches the messages through the `/api/messages/{conversation_id}` endpoint.
   - User B marks the message as read, and the system updates the `is_read` field.

---

### Summary

1. **Database Design**: Use tables for `Conversations`, `Conversation_Participants`, `Messages`, and `Media` to store text and media messages.
2. **API Endpoints**: Provide endpoints for sending text messages, media messages (images/videos), and retrieving messages.
3. **Notifications**: Use push or in-app notifications to alert users about new messages.
4. **Media Storage**: Store media files (images/videos) in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) and link them to messages via URLs.

This design will allow you to handle both text and media messages efficiently while providing a seamless experience for users in your messaging system.

Group messaging is an extension of the direct messaging (DM) system where multiple users can participate in a conversation. It requires slightly more complex handling in terms of database schema, user management, and message routing. Here’s how you can design group messaging, including sending and receiving messages, adding/removing participants, and handling media messages.

### Key Features of Group Messaging:
1. **Multiple Participants**: Group messages can have multiple participants.
2. **Message Flow**: Messages should be sent to all participants in the group.
3. **Message Types**: Text and media messages (image/video) should be supported.
4. **Group Management**: Users can join, leave, or be removed from a group.
5. **Read Status**: Track whether each participant has read a message.
6. **Group Information**: Each group has a name, description, and possibly an image.

### 1. **Database Schema for Group Messages**

The schema for group messaging extends the basic direct messaging schema by introducing concepts for groups, including managing participants and storing group-specific data.

#### Tables:
1. **Users**: Stores user information (`user_id`, `username`, etc.).
2. **Groups**: Represents a group chat.
   - `group_id` (PK) — Unique ID for the group.
   - `group_name` (string) — Name of the group (e.g., “Family Chat”).
   - `group_image_url` (optional) — Image for the group (e.g., a group avatar).
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — When the group was created.
   - `updated_at` (timestamp) — Last time the group was updated.
   - `is_active` (boolean) — Indicates whether the group is active.

3. **Group_Participants**: Stores participants in the group.
   - `group_id` (FK) — ID of the group.
   - `user_id` (FK) — ID of the user participating in the group.
   - `joined_at` (timestamp) — When the user joined the group.
   - `is_admin` (boolean) — Whether the user is an admin of the group.
   - `is_active` (boolean) — Whether the user is still part of the group.

4. **Messages**: Stores all messages (text and media) in the group chat.
   - `message_id` (PK) — Unique message ID.
   - `group_id` (FK) — The group to which the message belongs.
   - `sender_id` (FK to Users.user_id) — The user who sent the message.
   - `message_type` (enum: `text`, `image`, `video`, etc.) — Type of message.
   - `message_content` (text) — Content of the message (text or URL for media).
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — When the message was sent.
   - `is_read` (boolean) — Whether the message has been read by the participant (not global, tracked per user).
  
5. **Media**: Stores media files associated with messages.
   - `media_id` (PK) — Unique ID for media.
   - `message_id` (FK) — The message to which the media belongs.
   - `media_type` (enum: `image`, `video`, etc.) — Type of media.
   - `file_url` (string) — URL to the media file (e.g., stored in AWS S3).
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — When the media was uploaded.

6. **Group_Notifications** (Optional): Store notifications for group activity.
   - `notification_id` (PK) — Unique ID for the notification.
   - `group_id` (FK) — The group to which the notification belongs.
   - `message_id` (FK) — The message triggering the notification.
   - `user_id` (FK to Users) — User who receives the notification.
   - `notification_type` (enum: `new_message`, `added_to_group`, `removed_from_group`) — Type of notification.
   - `created_at` (timestamp) — When the notification was created.

#### Example Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Groups (
    group_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_name VARCHAR(255),
    group_image_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

);

CREATE TABLE Group_Participants (
    group_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES Groups(group_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Messages (
    message_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id INT,
    sender_id INT,
    message_type ENUM('text', 'image', 'video'),
    message_content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES Groups(group_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Media (
    media_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    message_id INT,
    media_type ENUM('image', 'video'),
    file_url VARCHAR(255),

### 3. **Handling Notifications and Real-time Updates**

For real-time group message delivery, you can integrate **WebSockets** or use services like **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to send push notifications. This ensures that when a new message is posted in the group, all active participants are notified instantly.

### Summary of Key Operations:

1. **Group Creation**: Create a group with participants and assign an admin.
2. **Add/Remove Participants**: Manage who is part of the group.
3. **Sending Messages**: Users can send text and media messages to the group.
4. **Reading Messages**: Track who has read which messages.
5. **Notifications**: Notify users of new messages or changes in group participation.

This architecture will allow you to implement group messaging efficiently, supporting both text and media content while ensuring a seamless user experience for large groups.

To manage posts in a social media application (such as Instagram), including storing, retrieving, and viewing them, you need to design a system that supports posting, storing post data, and allowing efficient retrieval of posts. This involves creating a backend that handles storing posts in a database, retrieving posts for the feed (including images, videos, and text), and managing associated metadata such as likes, comments, and timestamps.

### Key Operations:
1. **Create Post**: Users can create posts (text, images, or videos).
2. **Store Post**: Posts and associated data (such as images or videos) are stored in the database and possibly a media storage service (e.g., AWS S3).
3. **View Post**: Users can view a post and its associated data, including likes, comments, and the post content.
4. **Retrieve Posts**: Posts should be efficiently retrieved based on certain parameters (e.g., by user or feed, including pagination for infinite scrolling).

### 1. **Database Schema Design for Posts**

You need several tables to store posts and their related data. Here's a possible schema:

#### Tables:

1. **Users**: Stores user details (`user_id`, `username`, etc.).
2. **Posts**: Stores the main data for each post (text, image/video URL, and metadata like likes, comments, etc.).
   - `post_id` (PK) — Unique identifier for the post.
   - `user_id` (FK) — ID of the user who created the post.
   - `content` (TEXT) — Post content (text of the post).
   - `image_url` (VARCHAR) — URL to the image or video (nullable, if the post is text only).
   - `video_url` (VARCHAR) — URL to the video (nullable, if the post is an image or text).
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) — Timestamp when the post was created.
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) — Timestamp when the post was last updated.
   - `is_deleted` (BOOLEAN) — Whether the post has been deleted (soft delete).
   
3. **Likes**: Stores the likes for each post.
   - `like_id` (PK) — Unique identifier for the like.
   - `post_id` (FK) — The post that was liked.
   - `user_id` (FK) — ID of the user who liked the post.
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) — Timestamp when the like was made.
   
4. **Comments**: Stores comments for each post.
   - `comment_id` (PK) — Unique identifier for the comment.
   - `post_id` (FK) — The post that was commented on.
   - `user_id` (FK) — ID of the user who made the comment.
   - `content` (TEXT) — Content of the comment.
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) — Timestamp when the comment was posted.
   
5. **Media** (optional for better media management): Stores media files associated with posts (if using cloud storage).
   - `media_id` (PK) — Unique identifier for the media file.
   - `post_id` (FK) — The post associated with the media.
   - `media_type` (ENUM: 'image', 'video') — Type of media.
   - `file_url` (VARCHAR) — URL pointing to the media file stored in cloud storage.

#### Example Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Posts (
    post_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    content TEXT,
    image_url VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    video_url VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Likes (
    like_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Posts(post_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Comments (
    comment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Posts(post_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Media (
    media_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INT,
    media_type ENUM('image', 'video'),
    file_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Posts(post_id)
);
```

### 2. **API Endpoints for Managing Posts**

Here’s a set of API endpoints to create, store, and retrieve posts, as well as to interact with likes and comments.

#### **Create Post** (Text, Image, or Video)
- **POST /api/posts/create**
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": 1,
      "content": "Check out this beautiful sunset!",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/sunset.jpg"
    }
    ```

          "comment_id": 2,
          "user_id": 3,
          "content": "So beautiful!",
          "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:10:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Fetch the post details from the `Posts` table using `post_id`.
  - Retrieve the likes count by counting rows in the `Likes` table for that `post_id`.

        },
        {
          "post_id": 124,
          "user_id": 2,
          "content": "Having a great time at the beach!",
          "image_url": "https://example.com/beach.jpg",
          "likes_count": 200,
          "comments_count": 15,
          "created_at": "2024-12-19T09:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Fetch posts for the feed based on the user’s activity (e.g., posts from followed users or all public posts).
  - Use pagination (`page` and `limit`) to control the number of posts returned.
  - Retrieve the likes and comments counts for each post and include them in the response.

#### **Like a Post**
- **POST /api/posts/{post_id}/like**

    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "post_id": 123,
      "user_id": 1,
      "likes_count": 121
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Insert a like into the `Likes` table for the post and user.
  - Update the like count for the post.

#### **Comment on a Post**
- **POST /api/posts/{post_id}/comment**
  - **Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": 2,
      "content": "Amazing view!"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "comment_id": 1,
      "user_id": 2,
      "content": "Amazing view!",
      "created_at": "2024-12-20T10:05:00Z"
    }
    ```

  **API Logic**:
  - Insert the comment into the `Comments` table for the given post.
  - Update the comment count for the post.

### 3. **Handling Media (Image/Video)**
When a post includes media (e.g., an image or video), you would typically upload the media to a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Firebase Storage, and store the URL of the media in your `Media` table or in the `Posts` table directly.

1. **Uploading Media**: Users upload media through the app, which is stored in cloud storage.
2. **Storing Media URL**: The URL of the uploaded media is saved in the `Posts` table or the `Media` table (if separating media handling).
3. **Serving Media**: When users view a post, the media URL is provided in the API response so the media can be shown in

Handling data flow for millions of users, ensuring real-time updates from smartphones to the server, and keeping the data synchronized across all users in real-time is a challenging but common requirement in social media apps (like Instagram or Facebook). Achieving real-time data updates efficiently requires a combination of backend architecture, real-time communication protocols, and distributed systems. Below is an explanation of how this can be done, including a diagram for visualizing the flow of data.

### Key Requirements:
1. **Real-time Communication**: Users should receive immediate updates (such as new posts, likes, or comments) as they happen.
2. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle millions of concurrent users without performance degradation.
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data is consistent across the system, especially when users interact with each other (e.g., liking a post or sending a message).
4. **Low Latency**: Updates should happen in near real-time with minimal delay.
5. **Efficient Data Flow**: The data flow from smartphones to the server and between users should be efficient, utilizing technologies like WebSockets, push notifications, and real-time messaging queues.

### System Components:
1. **Mobile Client (Smartphone)**:
   - The mobile app acts as the front-end, allowing users to post data (text, images, videos), interact with other users (likes, comments), and view updates in real-time.
   - The app communicates with the backend server via APIs, WebSockets, or push notifications for real-time updates.

2. **Backend Server**:
   - The backend is responsible for receiving data from mobile clients, processing it, storing it in the database, and pushing updates to other users who need to be notified.
   - The backend typically uses APIs (RESTful or GraphQL) to handle requests and WebSockets for real-time communication.

3. **Database**:
   - Stores user data, posts, likes, comments, and other persistent data. This could be an SQL or NoSQL database depending on the requirements.
   - The database is updated when new data is received from users, and it can send notifications to users when their data changes (e.g., new comments on a post).

4. **Real-Time Messaging/Notification Service**:
   - **WebSockets**: A communication protocol that enables two-way interaction between the mobile client and the server. It keeps the connection open, allowing the server to send updates to the client as soon as changes occur.
   - **Push Notifications**: Push notifications are used when users are not actively using the app, alerting them to new messages, likes, or other events.
   - **Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)**: In highly scalable systems, message queues ensure that real-time updates are processed efficiently and in the right order.

5. **Cache Layer (Optional)**:
   - A caching layer (e.g., Redis) can be used to temporarily store frequently accessed data (e.g., the latest posts) to reduce load on the database and improve read performance.

### Data Flow Diagram: 

Here's how data flows from the smartphone to the server and is updated across other users in real-time:

```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **User Interaction on Mobile (Smartphone)**:
   - When a user interacts with the mobile app (e.g., liking a post, posting a comment, or uploading a new post), the mobile app makes an **API request** to the backend server.
   - For example, if a user likes a post, the app sends a request to the backend to record the like in the database.

2. **Backend Server**:
   - The backend server receives the API request and processes it.
   - If it's a post (text/image/video), the server stores the data in the database.
   - If it’s a real-time event (like a new like or comment), the backend triggers a **WebSocket notification** to notify the relevant users.

3. **WebSocket Server for Real-Time Updates**:
   - WebSockets allow the server to establish a persistent, open connection with the mobile app. When the server processes an event (like a new comment), it pushes a real-time update to all connected clients.
   - For example, when a new like or comment happens, all users who have the post open (or are following the post) will immediately see the update without having to refresh.

4. **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**:
   - In large-scale systems, a **message queue** is used to handle the flow of events efficiently. When a user interacts with the app (e.g., posts a comment or likes a post), the backend sends a message to the queue.
   - This decouples the real-time event processing and helps ensure that all users who need to be notified receive updates in the correct order, even if the system is under heavy load.

5. **Database (SQL/NoSQL)**:
   - The backend updates the database with the new post, comment, or like.
   - The database may also trigger events (e.g., through triggers or polling) to update the system or notify other users.

6. **Cache Layer (Optional)**:
   - To improve performance, frequently accessed data (such as recent posts or user timelines) is cached in a **cache layer** (e.g., Redis). This reduces the number of queries to the database and speeds up data retrieval for real-time updates.
   
7. **Push Notification**:
   - For users who are not actively using the app, the system can send a **push notification** (using services like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notifications).
   - Push notifications alert the user about new interactions, like comments or likes, ensuring the user gets notified even when they aren't actively interacting with the app.

8. **Real-Time Updates to Other Users**:
   - When a user posts a new comment, likes a post, or makes a similar interaction, the server sends updates to all other connected users through the **WebSocket connection** or triggers a **push notification**.
   - For example, if a user likes a post, all users following that post receive an update in real-time.

### Technologies for Real-Time Communication:

1. **WebSockets**: 
   - Allows a two-way communication channel between the mobile client and the server, which is kept open. It's ideal for sending real-time updates such as new posts, likes, and comments.
   - WebSockets are used to push updates to users who have the app open.

2. **Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**: 
   - A message queue handles large volumes of events (e.g., likes, posts, or comments) and ensures that these events are processed and delivered to other users efficiently.
   - Kafka or RabbitMQ can be used to manage the flow of notifications, especially in highly scalable systems.

3. **Push Notifications**:
   - Push notifications are ideal for reaching users who are not actively using the app, notifying them of important events like new comments or likes.

4. **Database and Cache**:
   - Databases (SQL/NoSQL) store user data, posts, likes, and comments, while **Redis** or similar caching systems can store frequently accessed data like recent posts, ensuring fast access.

### Handling Millions of Users:
1. **Scalability**:
   - The backend must be scalable horizontally to handle millions of users. **Load balancers** and **auto-scaling** features can be used to ensure that the system can handle varying loads and traffic spikes.
   
2. **Sharding the Database**:
   - For very large datasets (millions of users and posts), databases can be **sharded** to split the data across multiple servers, ensuring faster access and reducing the load on individual servers.

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - WebSocket connections or API requests can be distributed across multiple backend servers using a **load balancer**, ensuring that no single server becomes overwhelmed with requests.

### Conclusion:
The flow of data in a system with millions of users can be efficiently handled by using a combination of real-time communication (WebSockets, push notifications), message queues, scalable databases, and caching systems. This architecture ensures that user interactions are updated in real-time across all connected users while maintaining scalability and low latency.

---

Designing a system that serves real-time data to millions of users, such as a social media platform or any application that needs to handle a large volume of concurrent users, involves a few critical components and technologies. Below, I'll guide you through the architecture, components, and Python code that can be used to implement such a system.

### Key Requirements:
- **Real-time Data Serving**: Users should get updates instantly when new data is posted, updated, or interacted with (e.g., comments, likes).
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of concurrent users and a large amount of data (e.g., posts, comments).
- **Low Latency**: Users should see updates with minimal delay.

### High-Level Architecture Overview:

1. **Mobile Clients (Smartphones)**:
   - Communicate with the backend to fetch updates (like new posts, comments, or likes) and send real-time data such as comments or likes.

2. **Backend Server**:
   - **WebSocket Server**: Establishes persistent connections to handle real-time data. Python WebSockets are used for bidirectional communication.
   - **REST API Server**: Handles standard API calls for creating, updating, and retrieving posts and other data.
   
3. **Database**:
   - Store user data, posts, likes, comments, etc. A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) or SQL database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL) can be used.
   - Data is updated asynchronously based on real-time events.

4. **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**:
   - Used to distribute events (like a new comment or like) efficiently to different parts of the system and notify users in real-time.

5. **Cache Layer**:
   - A caching layer (e.g., **Redis**) can be used to store frequently accessed data (like recent posts or user timelines) to minimize database load and improve performance.

### System Design Flow:

1. **Client-side (Smartphone)**:
   - The app sends HTTP requests to the server (REST APIs) to create or retrieve posts.
   - It also maintains a WebSocket connection to receive real-time updates when there are new interactions (like comments, likes, or new posts).
   
2. **Backend**:
   - When a user posts a new comment, the backend updates the database and pushes the event to a message queue.
   - The backend then broadcasts the event (using WebSocket or Push Notification) to the affected users.

3. **Database**:
   - The database stores all data, such as user information, posts, likes, comments, and timestamps. Any changes in the data will be reflected here.

4. **Message Queue**:
   - When an event happens (like a new post or a comment), a message is placed in the message queue, which can then notify relevant users through WebSockets or other mechanisms.

5. **Real-Time Data Push**:
   - WebSocket connections are maintained open, and whenever a relevant event occurs, the backend pushes updates to the clients through the WebSocket connection.

### Python Code Implementation:

#### Requirements:
1. **WebSocket Server**: Use **WebSockets** to push updates to clients.
2. **Flask**: Use Flask for creating REST APIs.
3. **Redis**: Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
4. **Database**: Use **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for storing data.
5. **Celery**: If background tasks are needed (e.g., processing data after events).

We will use the following Python libraries:
- `flask`: For the REST API.
- `flask-socketio`: To implement WebSocket connections.
- `redis`: For caching frequently accessed data.
- `pymongo`: For MongoDB interactions (if using MongoDB).
- `apscheduler` or `celery`: For handling background tasks (if required).

### Step-by-Step Python Code Example:

#### 1. **Backend Server Setup (Flask + WebSockets)**

```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio pymongo redis
```

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
import redis
import pymongo
from bson import ObjectId
import json

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# MongoDB Client
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["social_media"]

# Redis Client
cache = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Socket event for a new post (this will be sent to all connected clients)
@socketio.on('new_post')
def handle_new_post(data):
    """Notify all users about a new post."""
    emit('update_feed', data, broadcast=True)

# Endpoint to create a new post (REST API)
@app.route('/api/posts', methods=['POST'])
def create_post():
    user_id = request.json.get('user_id')
    content = request.json.get('content')
    image_url = request.json.get('image_url', None)
    
    # Save the post to MongoDB
    post_data = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "content": content,
        "image_url": image_url,
        "created_at": "2024-12-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
    post_id = db.posts.insert_one(post_data).inserted_id
    
    # Push event to notify users in real-time
    post_data["post_id"] = str(post_id)
    socketio.emit('new_post', post_data, broadcast=True)
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Post created successfully", "post_id": str(post_id)}), 201

# Endpoint to get posts (for feed)
@app.route('/api/posts', methods=['GET'])
def get_posts():
    # Get posts from MongoDB or cache if available
    cached_data = cache.get('latest_posts')
    if cached_data:
        return jsonify(json.loads(cached_data))
    
    posts = db.posts.find().sort('created_at', -1).limit(20)  # Fetch latest 20 posts
    posts_data = [{"post_id": str(post["_id"]), "content": post["content"], "image_url": post.get("image_url", None)} for post in posts]
    
    # Cache the posts data for faster access
    cache.set('latest_posts', json.dumps(posts_data), ex=60)  # Cache for 1 minute
    
    return jsonify(posts_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **WebSocket Handling**:
   - The `SocketIO` object is used to establish a WebSocket connection with the clients.
   - When a new post is created via the `create_post` API, the server pushes the post data to all connected clients using `emit('new_post', data, broadcast=True)`.

2. **Creating a New Post**:
   - When a user creates a new post (via a POST request to `/api/posts`), the post is saved to the MongoDB database, and the event is broadcast to all connected WebSocket clients.
   - This allows other users to see the new post immediately without needing to refresh.

3. **Retrieving Posts**:
   - The `/api/posts` endpoint retrieves the latest 20 posts from the database.
   - The posts are cached using Redis to improve performance and reduce database load.

4. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - When a new post is created, the backend uses WebSockets to push updates to all connected users in real time.
   
5. **Redis Caching**:
   - Redis is used to cache the list of latest posts, which reduces the load on the database for frequently requested data.

### 2. **Frontend WebSocket Client (Smartphone App)**

In the mobile client (e.g., React Native, Flutter), you would establish a WebSocket connection to receive real-time updates.

```javascript
import io from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:5000");

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to server");
});

// Listen for new posts in real-time
socket.on("new_post", (data) => {
  console.log("New post received:", data);
  // Update the UI with the new post
});
```

### 3. **Scalability and Handling Millions of Users**:

For scalability, you can consider the following:

- **Sharding and Load Balancing**: 
  - Use **horizontal scaling** for your WebSocket server by deploying multiple instances and using a **load balancer** (e.g., Nginx) to distribute the connections.
  - Use **database sharding** to distribute data across multiple database instances to handle millions of users efficiently.

- **Redis Pub/Sub for Scaling**:
  - When your application needs to scale, Redis can be used in **Pub/Sub** mode to broadcast events to multiple WebSocket servers running on different instances.

- **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**:
  - For highly reliable event-driven architecture, use a **message queue** to decouple parts of your application, ensuring events are processed asynchronously and efficiently.

### Conclusion:

This design uses Python with Flask and SocketIO to serve real-time data to millions of users, utilizing MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching, and WebSocket connections to provide low-latency real-time updates. This system can scale horizontally with multiple WebSocket instances and can handle a large number of concurrent users while ensuring real-time interactions like likes, comments, and posts are immediately reflected to all users.


---


Using **Apache Kafka** for real-time data serving is an excellent choice for handling millions of users and ensuring that your system is scalable and reliable. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can manage high-throughput, fault-tolerant event-driven systems, making it ideal for managing real-time data flow for millions of users.

In this example, we'll integrate **Kafka** to serve real-time updates to users, handle events like new posts, comments, likes, and update the users' feeds effectively.

### Key Components in Kafka Architecture:
1. **Producer**: This is the service that sends messages to Kafka topics (e.g., when a user posts something or likes a post).
2. **Kafka Broker**: The Kafka server that stores and distributes messages.
3. **Consumer**: The service that reads messages from Kafka topics (e.g., to notify users of new posts, comments, or likes).
4. **Topics**: Kafka organizes messages into topics. Each event (like a new post, like, or comment) can be a separate topic, or you can group similar events into one topic.

### Architecture Design:
1. **Backend Server (Flask)**:
   - The backend serves APIs for creating posts, likes, comments, and fetching feeds.
   - It produces events (like new post creation or like) to Kafka.
   - Consumers listen for those events and then push updates to the clients via WebSockets.
   
2. **Kafka Cluster**:
   - A Kafka cluster handles the messaging backbone. It receives events from producers and sends events to consumers.
   - It can be scaled horizontally to handle millions of events.

3. **WebSocket Client**:
   - The WebSocket client (typically a mobile app) listens for updates pushed by the backend to Kafka and receives the data in real time.

### Kafka System Flow:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - A user interacts with the app (e.g., creates a new post, likes a post).
   
2. **Backend Produces Event**:
   - The backend sends an event (such as new post creation or a like) to Kafka.
   
3. **Kafka Broker**:
   - Kafka stores the event in a topic and ensures reliable delivery of messages.

4. **Kafka Consumer**:
   - A consumer (such as a backend service or worker) subscribes to the topic and processes the event (e.g., sends notifications to users).

5. **WebSocket Notification**:
   - The consumer notifies users about the event (like new posts or comments) by pushing updates to them via WebSocket.

### Step-by-Step Python Code Implementation:

#### Requirements:
1. **Kafka**: Install Kafka and run a Kafka broker.
2. **Python Libraries**: Use `kafka-python` for Kafka producer and consumer, `flask-socketio` for WebSocket support.

```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio kafka-python redis pymongo
```

### 1. **Kafka Setup**

To set up Kafka locally, download and run the Kafka broker from [Kafka's official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

Start Kafka server:

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Create a Kafka topic:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic new_posts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

### 2. **Producer - Backend Flask Application (Push Events to Kafka)**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
import pymongo
import redis
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# MongoDB Setup
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["social_media"]

# Redis Setup for caching posts
cache = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)

# Kafka Producer Setup
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda x: json.dumps(x).encode('utf-8'))

# Send a new post event to Kafka topic
@app.route('/api/posts', methods=['POST'])
def create_post():
    user_id = request.json.get('user_id')
    content = request.json.get('content')
    image_url = request.json.get('image_url', None)

    # Save post to MongoDB
    post_data = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "content": content,
        "image_url": image_url,
        "created_at": time.time()
    }
    post_id = db.posts.insert_one(post_data).inserted_id
    
    # Prepare message to send to Kafka
    post_data["post_id"] = str(post_id)
    
    # Push message to Kafka topic "new_posts"
    producer.send('new_posts', post_data)
    
    # Emit message to notify clients in real-time via WebSocket
    socketio.emit('new_post', post_data, broadcast=True)
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Post created successfully", "post_id": str(post_id)}), 201

# Get latest posts (cached in Redis or from DB)
@app.route('/api/posts', methods=['GET'])
def get_posts():
    cached_data = cache.get('latest_posts')
    if cached_data:
        return jsonify(json.loads(cached_data))

    posts = db.posts.find().sort('created_at', -1).limit(20)
    posts_data = [{"post_id": str(post["_id"]), "content": post["content"], "image_url": post.get("image_url", None)} for post in posts]
    
    # Cache the latest posts for future requests
    cache.set('latest_posts', json.dumps(posts_data), ex=60)  # Cache for 1 minute
    
    return jsonify(posts_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### 3. **Kafka Consumer (Handle Events from Kafka and Push Updates to Clients)**

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

# Setup Flask app and SocketIO
app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# Kafka Consumer Setup
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'new_posts',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_deserializer=lambda x: json.loads(x.decode('utf-8')),
    group_id='post-consumers'
)

# Kafka Consumer Loop (Listens for New Posts and Notifies Clients)
def consume_new_posts():
    for message in consumer:
        post_data = message.value
        print("New post received:", post_data)
        socketio.emit('new_post', post_data, broadcast=True)  # Push to all clients

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start Kafka consumer in a background thread
    socketio.start_background_task(consume_new_posts)
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

### 4. **Frontend WebSocket Client (Smartphone)**

In the mobile app (e.g., React Native, Flutter), you can listen for WebSocket events to receive real-time updates:

```javascript
import io from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:5000");

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to server");
});

// Listen for new posts in real-time
socket.on("new_post", (data) => {
  console.log("New post received:", data);
  // Update the UI with the new post
});
```

### Key Concepts in This System:

1. **Producer (Backend)**:
   - When a new post is created, the backend sends the post details to a Kafka topic (`new_posts`) using the `KafkaProducer`.
   - The backend also caches posts in **Redis** for fast retrieval and updates the UI with **WebSocket** notifications.

2. **Consumer (Kafka)**:
   - A separate service listens for events on the Kafka topic (`new_posts`) using `KafkaConsumer`.
   - When a new post event is received, it pushes real-time updates to clients using **WebSockets**.

3. **WebSocket Notifications**:
   - Both the **Backend** and **Kafka Consumer** push updates to the mobile client via **WebSocket** to notify users about new posts, comments, or other interactions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Kafka handles high-throughput events and ensures that each event is reliably processed, even as the number of users grows.
   - Multiple consumers can read from Kafka in parallel to scale the real-time processing.

### Conclusion:
By integrating **Kafka**, **Redis**, and **Flask-SocketIO**, this system can handle millions of users with low latency and high reliability. Kafka efficiently manages real-time data streams, ensuring that every user receives updates instantly when new events occur, such as posting new content or interacting with others.

There are several alternatives to WebSockets for real-time notifications, each with its own advantages and use cases. Some of the most common alternatives are:

### 1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
   - **Description**: SSE is a simple, one-way communication method from the server to the client over an HTTP connection. The server sends updates to the client whenever there is new data.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Easier to implement than WebSockets.
     - Built-in support in modern browsers.
     - Good for broadcasting real-time updates to many clients (e.g., notifications, news updates).
   - **Cons**: 
     - One-way communication (from server to client only).
     - Limited support for very high-frequency updates or complex two-way communication.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that need to push updates to clients, like social media updates, news feeds, or live scores.

### 2. **HTTP Long Polling**
   - **Description**: With long polling, the client makes a request to the server and holds the connection open until the server has new data to send. Once data is sent, the client immediately sends a new request to the server.
   - **Pros**:
     - Works on all browsers and environments (even if WebSockets or SSE are not supported).
     - Can be more reliable for environments with firewalls or strict network policies.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Less efficient than WebSockets, as each new message requires a new HTTP request.
     - Higher latency due to the need to constantly re-establish connections.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where WebSockets are not viable or where compatibility with older systems is needed.

### 3. **Push Notifications**
   - **Description**: Push notifications are typically used for mobile applications or web apps that need to notify users about updates even when they aren't actively using the app. Push notifications use a push notification service (like Apple Push Notification Service or Firebase Cloud Messaging).
   - **Pros**:
     - Can send notifications to clients even when they are not actively connected or running the app.
     - Great for mobile apps and native apps.
   - **Cons**:
     - Not always real-time due to reliance on third-party services.
     - More complex setup and need for third-party services (e.g., Firebase, APNs).
   - **Use Case**: Mobile apps, or web apps needing background notifications, like messaging apps or social networks.

### 4. **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**
   - **Description**: MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol often used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It allows for real-time communication with low bandwidth usage.
   - **Pros**:
     - Low overhead and efficient for mobile and IoT devices.
     - Supports real-time message delivery.
     - Offers quality of service levels for message reliability.
   - **Cons**:
     - May require a specialized MQTT broker to manage the connections.
     - Not as widely supported by web browsers as WebSockets.
   - **Use Case**: IoT applications, mobile apps, and systems where lightweight communication is important.

### 5. **GraphQL Subscriptions**
   - **Description**: GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to listen to specific events or changes in data over a WebSocket connection. It provides a real-time, event-driven approach for querying data.
   - **Pros**:
     - Built-in support for real-time updates in GraphQL-based applications.
     - Works well with GraphQL queries and mutations.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires a GraphQL server and proper subscription management.
     - Complexity in scaling and managing WebSocket connections.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for GraphQL-based applications that need real-time data synchronization.

### 6. **Pusher / Firebase Realtime Database**
   - **Description**: Pusher and Firebase are services that provide real-time functionality with low latency for web and mobile applications. These services abstract away the complexity of managing WebSockets and other protocols.
   - **Pros**:
     - Easy to implement with SDKs and documentation.
     - Real-time updates with minimal setup.
     - Built-in features like event broadcasting, presence channels, and data storage.
   - **Cons**:
     - Costs can scale with usage.
     - Less control over the underlying infrastructure.
   - **Use Case**: For applications that need simple, fast implementation of real-time notifications and collaboration features.

### 7. **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**
   - **Description**: WebRTC is a peer-to-peer communication protocol primarily used for video, audio, and data sharing. While not traditionally used for notifications, it can handle real-time data transfer between clients.
   - **Pros**:
     - Very low-latency communication.
     - Supports peer-to-peer communication.
   - **Cons**:
     - More complex than WebSockets or SSE.
     - Requires handling signaling and peer discovery.
   - **Use Case**: Real-time video chat, file sharing, and communication apps.

### Choosing the Right Solution:
- **For server-to-client notifications**: Use **SSE** or **Push Notifications** (for mobile/web).
- **For low-latency and efficient communication**: **WebSockets** or **MQTT**.
- **For GraphQL-powered apps**: **GraphQL subscriptions**.
- **For apps with minimal backend management**: **Pusher** or **Firebase**.

Each of these technologies can suit different use cases depending on your application's requirements.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a mechanism that allows a server to send real-time updates to a browser over a single HTTP connection. It is based on the `text/event-stream` MIME type and is a simple alternative to WebSockets for sending real-time data from the server to the client.

### How SSE Works:
- The client (typically a browser) makes an HTTP request to a server with the `Accept: text/event-stream` header.
- The server sends data in a specific event stream format, and the connection remains open.
- The client can receive events continuously as long as the connection is open.

### Setting Up SSE in Python

To implement SSE in Python, we can use the `Flask` framework to easily handle HTTP requests and responses. Here’s a step-by-step guide to implementing SSE:

1. **Install Flask:**
   You can install Flask via pip if you don't have it already:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Create a Flask Application with SSE:**

   Below is an example implementation of SSE with Flask. This will create a server that sends periodic events to the client.

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, Response
   import time

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # The route to stream events
   @app.route('/events')
   def sse():
       def event_stream():
           while True:
               # Sending an event every 1 second
               yield f"data: The current time is {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}\n\n"
               time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second

       return Response(event_stream(), mimetype='text/event-stream')

   # A simple homepage to test SSE in the browser
   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       return '''
           <html>
               <head>
                   <title>Server-Sent Events Example</title>
               </head>
               <body>
                   <h1>Server-Sent Events</h1>
                   <div id="events"></div>
                   <script type="text/javascript">
                       const eventSource = new EventSource('/events');
                       eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
                           const newElement = document.createElement("div");
                           newElement.textContent = event.data;
                           document.getElementById("events").appendChild(newElement);
                       };
                   </script>
               </body>
           </html>
       '''

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True, threaded=True)
   ```

### Breakdown of the Code:

- **`/events` route**: This route is responsible for the SSE connection. It returns a `Response` with the MIME type `text/event-stream`, which tells the browser that it will receive server-sent events.
  
- **`event_stream` generator**: This function yields event data continuously. The `yield` statement ensures the connection stays open and the server sends a new event every time the loop runs. In this example, we are sending the current time every second.

- **JavaScript Client**: The JavaScript code listens for events sent from the server. When a message is received, the data is displayed in the `#events` div.

- **`threaded=True`**: This ensures that Flask can handle multiple requests simultaneously, which is important for real-time applications.

### Running the Application:
1. Save the Python code to a file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Run the application by executing:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the time updates in real-time every second.

### Important Notes:
- SSE is a one-way communication from the server to the client. If you need two-way communication (i.e., client sending data to the server), you might need to combine SSE with other techniques like AJAX or WebSockets.
- SSE requires HTTP/1.1 or higher and supports automatic reconnection in case the connection drops.
- If you're deploying the application, ensure that your server (like Nginx) is configured to keep HTTP connections open for long periods.

This implementation gives you a simple and effective way to send real-time data to clients using Server-Sent Events.

HTTP Long Polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until there is new information available or a timeout occurs. Once new data is available, the server responds to the request, after which the client immediately re-establishes the connection by sending another request. This technique allows the server to push data to the client in near real-time while using the traditional HTTP protocol.

Here's how you can implement HTTP Long Polling in Python using the `Flask` web framework.

### Steps:

1. **Install Flask:**
   First, you need to install Flask (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Create the Long Polling Server:**

   Below is an implementation of HTTP Long Polling in Python with Flask:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
   import time
   import threading

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # A list to store clients waiting for updates
   clients = []

   # A simple function to simulate data update (e.g., from a sensor or event)
   def data_updater():
       while True:
           # Simulate data changes and notify clients
           time.sleep(5)  # Wait 5 seconds between updates
           for client in clients:
               # Notify all clients with some new data
               client['response'].set_data(f"data: New event occurred at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}\n\n")
               client['response'].flush()  # Ensure the data is sent immediately

   # Long polling route
   @app.route('/long-poll')
   def long_poll():
       # Create a response object that will hold the data until it's updated
       response = app.response_class(status=200, mimetype='text/event-stream')
       
       # Store the client response for later updates
       clients.append({'response': response})
       
       # Wait for the event to be triggered or a timeout (simulate long polling)
       # You could add a timeout condition here as well
       return response

   # Route to simulate a simple client interface
   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       return '''
           <html>
               <head>
                   <title>HTTP Long Polling Example</title>
               </head>
               <body>
                   <h1>Long Polling Updates</h1>
                   <div id="events"></div>
                   <script type="text/javascript">
                       function fetchUpdates() {
                           const eventSource = new EventSource('/long-poll');
                           eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
                               const newElement = document.createElement("div");
                               newElement.textContent = event.data;
                               document.getElementById("events").appendChild(newElement);
                               fetchUpdates();  // Reconnect immediately after receiving a message
                           };
                       }
                       fetchUpdates();
                   </script>
               </body>
           </html>
       '''

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       # Start a separate thread to simulate data updates
       threading.Thread(target=data_updater, daemon=True).start()
       app.run(debug=True, threaded=True)
   ```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`clients` List**: This is a list that stores the client connections (i.e., the responses that are waiting for data updates).

2. **`data_updater` Function**: This function simulates an event or data change every 5 seconds. For every data update, it goes through all clients (stored in the `clients` list) and sends them the new data by setting the response data using `response.set_data()`.

3. **`/long-poll` Route**: This is where the long polling occurs. When a client requests this route, the server keeps the request open until it sends a data update. The request remains open as the client waits for the server to push data back.

4. **Client-side JavaScript**: The client continuously polls the server by invoking the `/long-poll` endpoint. When data is received (via the `onmessage` event), the client immediately reconnects by calling `fetchUpdates()` again to wait for the next update.

5. **`threaded=True`**: This argument allows Flask to handle multiple requests simultaneously (important for handling many clients).

6. **Data simulation**: The `data_updater()` function simulates data changes every 5 seconds, which are pushed to all clients waiting for updates.

### How It Works:

- The server holds the HTTP request open until new data is available (or until the timeout occurs).
- The client waits for the server response and once received, the connection is closed. Then, the client immediately sends another request to the server for new data.
- In the provided example, after every event update from the server, the client re-establishes the long-polling connection.

### Running the Application:
1. Save the Python script (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Run it:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The browser will receive updates from the server every 5 seconds.

### Important Considerations:
- **Timeouts**: You can introduce timeouts on the server side if needed. Flask doesn’t have built-in support for request timeouts, but you could manually check if too much time has passed before responding.
- **Performance**: Long polling may cause some performance concerns with many clients, as each open connection consumes server resources. If your application scales, you may want to consider switching to WebSockets or SSE for more efficient real-time communication.

### Conclusion:
HTTP Long Polling is a simple method to achieve real-time communication between a client and a server, though it can be less efficient than other techniques like WebSockets for applications that require high throughput or scalability. This Python Flask implementation is good for small-scale real-time apps or as an introductory approach to long-lived HTTP connections.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight and widely used messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or low-bandwidth networks. It follows a publish-subscribe model, where clients can publish messages to topics and subscribe to topics to receive messages.

To implement MQTT in Python, we need to use a library such as `paho-mqtt`, which is an MQTT client library that allows Python applications to interact with MQTT brokers (servers) to publish and subscribe to messages.

### Steps to implement MQTT in Python:

1. **Install the `paho-mqtt` library**:

   First, you need to install the `paho-mqtt` library, which will be used to create the MQTT client.

   ```bash
   pip install paho-mqtt
   ```

2. **Set up the MQTT Broker**:

   - You can either run your own MQTT broker (e.g., using **Eclipse Mosquitto** or **HiveMQ**) or use a cloud-based broker (e.g., **CloudMQTT**, **Adafruit IO**, **ThingSpeak**).
   - For local testing, you can install **Mosquitto** broker:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install mosquitto
     sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
     ```

   - Or you can use public brokers like:
     - **broker.hivemq.com** (public broker)
     - **test.mosquitto.org** (public broker)

3. **Python MQTT Publisher and Subscriber Example**:

   Below are two Python scripts: one for the publisher (client that sends messages) and one for the subscriber (client that listens for messages).

#### MQTT Publisher (Publisher.py)

This script will connect to an MQTT broker and publish messages to a topic.

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

# Callback function when the client connects to the broker
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")
    # Publish a message to a topic after connecting
    client.publish("test/topic", "Hello MQTT!")

# Create an MQTT client instance
client = mqtt.Client()

# Attach the connect callback function
client.on_connect = on_connect

# Connect to the broker (local or public broker)
client.connect("broker.hivemq.com", 1883, 60)  # You can replace with your broker address

# Start the network loop to handle events
client.loop_start()

# Wait for some time to allow the connection and publish
time.sleep(2)

# Stop the loop
client.loop_stop()
```

#### MQTT Subscriber (Subscriber.py)

This script will connect to the MQTT broker, subscribe to a topic, and wait for messages.

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Callback function when the client connects to the broker
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")
    # Subscribe to a topic after connecting
    client.subscribe("test/topic")

# Callback function when a message is received
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Received message: {msg.payload.decode()} on topic: {msg.topic}")

# Create an MQTT client instance
client = mqtt.Client()

# Attach the connect and message callback functions
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the broker (local or public broker)
client.connect("broker.hivemq.com", 1883, 60)  # You can replace with your broker address

# Start the network loop to handle events
client.loop_forever()
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **`on_connect` Callback**:
   - This function is triggered when the MQTT client successfully connects to the broker.
   - In the publisher, after connecting, it sends a message to the topic `test/topic`.
   - In the subscriber, it subscribes to `test/topic` to receive messages.

2. **`on_message` Callback**:
   - This function is triggered whenever a message is received on a subscribed topic. The message content is printed to the console.

3. **MQTT Client**:
   - `mqtt.Client()` creates a new MQTT client instance.
   - `client.connect()` connects the client to the broker.
   - `client.loop_start()` and `client.loop_forever()` start the loop to handle network communication and messages.

4. **MQTT Broker**:
   - In the examples, I used the **HiveMQ** public broker (`broker.hivemq.com`), but you can replace it with a private broker or a different public one.
   - Default port for MQTT is `1883` (non-secure), and `8883` is for secure MQTT connections using TLS/SSL.

### Running the Publisher and Subscriber:

1. **Run the Subscriber**:
   - Open a terminal and run the subscriber script:

   ```bash
   python Subscriber.py
   ```

   The subscriber will connect to the MQTT broker and wait for messages.

2. **Run the Publisher**:
   - Open another terminal and run the publisher script:

   ```bash
   python Publisher.py
   ```

   The publisher will connect to the broker, send a message to the topic `test/topic`, and the subscriber will receive it.

### Advanced Topics (Optional):

1. **Quality of Service (QoS)**:
   MQTT supports three levels of Quality of Service (QoS):
   - **QoS 0**: At most once (no guarantee of delivery).
   - **QoS 1**: At least once (guaranteed delivery but may be delivered multiple times).
   - **QoS 2**: Exactly once (guaranteed delivery, no duplicates).

   You can specify the QoS level when subscribing or publishing messages. For example:

   ```python
   client.subscribe("test/topic", qos=1)
   ```

2. **Last Will and Testament (LWT)**:
   MQTT clients can set a "last will" message that the broker sends if the client disconnects unexpectedly. This is useful for notifying other clients of a client's disconnection.

   ```python
   client.will_set("test/topic", payload="Client disconnected", qos=1, retain=True)
   ```

3. **Secure MQTT (TLS/SSL)**:
   To secure the communication between the MQTT client and broker, you can enable TLS/SSL encryption by specifying the necessary parameters, such as the server certificate and private key.

4. **Retained Messages**:
   MQTT allows a message to be "retained" by the broker. When a new client subscribes to a topic, it immediately receives the last retained message for that topic.

   You can set the retained flag when publishing:

   ```python
   client.publish("test/topic", "Hello MQTT!", retain=True)
   ```

### Conclusion:

The above examples demonstrate a basic MQTT setup using Python and `paho-mqtt` for publishing and subscribing to messages. MQTT is highly scalable and efficient, making it suitable for IoT applications, real-time messaging, and other use cases where lightweight and reliable communication is needed.

GraphQL Subscriptions enable real-time communication between clients and servers, allowing the server to push updates to the client whenever data changes. It is a critical feature for building interactive, real-time applications. In Python, you can implement GraphQL Subscriptions using the `Graphene` library, which provides tools for building GraphQL APIs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implement GraphQL Subscriptions in Python using `Graphene` and `Ariadne`.

### Prerequisites:
- **Graphene**: A library for building GraphQL APIs in Python.
- **Ariadne**: A Python library for GraphQL subscriptions, which allows asynchronous event-driven programming.
- **AsyncIO**: To handle asynchronous code needed for GraphQL subscriptions.
  
### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install graphene ariadne asyncio
```

### Step 2: Create the GraphQL Subscription Server

For the GraphQL Subscription implementation, we will need:
- **WebSocket**: The transport layer for subscriptions.
- **Graphene or Ariadne**: To build the GraphQL schema.

We’ll use **Ariadne** for creating subscriptions, as it provides excellent support for asynchronous GraphQL subscriptions. 

### Step 3: Implementing a Simple GraphQL Subscription Server

Let's implement a basic GraphQL subscription system using `Ariadne`. This example will simulate a simple "message" system where the server pushes new messages to the client in real-time.

#### Create the Python Server (`server.py`):

```python
import asyncio
from ariadne import make_executable_schema, load_schema_from_path, ObjectType, QueryType, SubscriptionType
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from typing import List

# Define your GraphQL schema
type_defs = """
    type Query {
        messages: [String!]!
    }

    type Subscription {
        messageAdded: String!
    }
"""

# Create query and subscription resolvers
query = QueryType()
subscription = SubscriptionType()

messages: List[str] = []  # A list to store messages

# Query Resolver to fetch messages
@query.field("messages")
def resolve_messages(_, info):
    return messages

# Subscription Resolver to push new messages
@subscription.field("messageAdded")
async def resolve_message_added(_, info):
    # This is where we will push new messages to subscribers
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Wait for 2 seconds before sending the next message
        if messages:
            yield messages[-1]  # Push the latest message to subscribers

# Create the executable schema
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query, subscription)

# Create the GraphQL app (ASGI application)
app = GraphQL(schema)

# To simulate adding new messages every few seconds
async def add_new_messages():
    counter = 1
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before adding a new message
        new_message = f"New message #{counter}"
        messages.append(new_message)
        counter += 1

# Run the asynchronous task to add new messages in the background
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.create_task(add_new_messages())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=4000)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **GraphQL Schema**:
   - We define the `Query` type to allow fetching a list of messages with the `messages` query.
   - We define the `Subscription` type to allow subscribing to real-time updates via the `messageAdded` subscription.

2. **Query Resolver**:
   - The `resolve_messages` function returns the list of messages when the `messages` query is called.

3. **Subscription Resolver**:
   - The `resolve_message_added` function is an asynchronous generator that sends new messages to the subscribers. It sends a new message every 2 seconds, simulating real-time message updates.
   - `await asyncio.sleep(2)` simulates waiting for new events (e.g., database updates, sensor readings, etc.).

4. **Message Simulation**:
   - The `add_new_messages` function runs in the background, periodically adding new messages to the `messages` list every 5 seconds. These messages are then pushed to subscribers via the `messageAdded` subscription.

5. **Ariadne ASGI App**:
   - The app is created using `Ariadne`'s `GraphQL` class, which serves the GraphQL endpoint.

6. **Running the Server**:
   - The server is run with **`uvicorn`**, an ASGI server that handles asynchronous web applications.

### Step 4: Run the GraphQL Subscription Server

To run the server, you can execute the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

This will start the GraphQL server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

### Step 5: Create the GraphQL Client

You can test the subscription with a GraphQL client like **GraphiQL** (web-based), **Apollo Client** (for JavaScript), or **Websockets** in Python. Below is an example using Python's `websockets` library to connect to the server.

#### Python Client (`client.py`):

Install the required library for the WebSocket client:

```bash
pip install websockets
```

Then, use the following code for the client:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

# Define the WebSocket URL for the GraphQL subscription
uri = "ws://127.0.0.1:4000"

async def subscribe_to_messages():
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        # Define the subscription query
        subscription_query = {
            "type": "start",
            "id": "1",
            "payload": {
                "query": """
                    subscription {
                        messageAdded
                    }
                """
            }
        }

        # Send the subscription request
        await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription_query))

        # Listen for messages from the server
        while True:
            response = await websocket.recv()
            data = json.loads(response)
            print(f"New message received: {data['payload']['data']['messageAdded']}")

# Run the WebSocket client
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(subscribe_to_messages())
```

### Explanation of the Client Code:

1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - The client connects to the server using `websockets.connect()` to the GraphQL WebSocket endpoint.

2. **Subscription Query**:
   - The client sends a subscription request with the `messageAdded` subscription. This tells the server to send new messages whenever they are added.

3. **Receive Messages**:
   - The client listens for new messages using `await websocket.recv()`. Each time a new message is sent from the server, it is printed to the console.

4. **Run the Client**:
   - The client listens indefinitely for new messages sent from the server.

### Step 6: Testing the Subscription

1. **Run the server** (`server.py`):

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Run the client** (`client.py`):

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

   The client will start receiving new messages as the server adds them. Every time a new message is added (every 5 seconds), it will be pushed to the client in real-time.

### Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to implement GraphQL Subscriptions using Python with **Ariadne**. By using the asynchronous capabilities of Python (`asyncio`), we can create a real-time GraphQL API where the server can push updates to subscribed clients in real-time. This setup is ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, live notifications, or any application that requires real-time data updates.
