Polymorphism in C++ is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one interface to be used for different data types. There are two primary types of polymorphism in C++:

1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)** - Achieved via function overloading and operator overloading.
2. **Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)** - Achieved via inheritance and function overriding, typically using virtual functions.

I'll explain each type with examples and outputs.

---

### 1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**

#### a. **Function Overloading**

Function overloading occurs when multiple functions have the same name but different parameters (either in number or type).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Printer {
public:
    // Function to print integer
    void print(int i) {
        cout << "Printing Integer: " << i << endl;
    }

    // Function to print float
    void print(float f) {
        cout << "Printing Float: " << f << endl;
    }

    // Function to print string
    void print(string s) {
        cout << "Printing String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Printer printer;
    printer.print(10);        // Calls the print(int)
    printer.print(3.14f);     // Calls the print(float)
    printer.print("Hello");   // Calls the print(string)

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Printing Integer: 10
Printing Float: 3.14
Printing String: Hello
```

#### b. **Operator Overloading**

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the functionality of operators like `+`, `-`, `=`, etc., for user-defined types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    int real;
    int imag;

public:
    Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {}

    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload '+' operator to add two Complex numbers
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Real: " << real << ", Imaginary: " << imag << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(1, 2), c2(3, 4);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Calls overloaded operator+
    c3.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Real: 4, Imaginary: 6
```

---

### 2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**

Runtime polymorphism is achieved via **inheritance** and **function overriding**. This allows the program to decide at runtime which function to call.

#### a. **Function Overriding with Virtual Functions**

To achieve runtime polymorphism, a base class function needs to be marked as `virtual` and should be overridden in a derived class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {  // Virtual function for drawing
        cout << "Drawing a Shape" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 1
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {  // Overriding the base class function
        cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 2
class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {  // Overriding the base class function
        cout << "Drawing a Square" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();  // Base class pointer, derived class object
    Shape* shape2 = new Square();

    shape1->draw();  // Calls Circle's draw
    shape2->draw();  // Calls Square's draw

    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Drawing a Circle
Drawing a Square
```

#### Explanation:
- The `draw()` function is virtual in the base class, so when it's called through a base class pointer (`Shape*`), C++ uses dynamic dispatch to call the appropriate overridden function in the derived class (either `Circle` or `Square`).
- Even though the pointer is of type `Shape*`, at runtime, the correct method is called based on the actual object type (either `Circle` or `Square`).

#### b. **Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**

A pure virtual function is a function that has no definition in the base class, making the class abstract. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract base class with a pure virtual function
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() = 0;  // Pure virtual function makes this class abstract
};

// Derived class 1
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Bark" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 2
class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Meow" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animal1 = new Dog();
    Animal* animal2 = new Cat();

    animal1->sound();  // Calls Dog's sound
    animal2->sound();  // Calls Cat's sound

    delete animal1;
    delete animal2;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Bark
Meow
```

#### Explanation:
- The class `Animal` has a pure virtual function `sound()`, which means any derived class must implement this function.
- In the main function, objects of `Dog` and `Cat` are created, and the appropriate `sound()` function is called based on the type of the object.

---

### Summary:
1. **Compile-time polymorphism** is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading. It allows the same function name to behave differently based on the arguments or operands.
2. **Runtime polymorphism** is achieved by inheritance and function overriding, primarily using virtual functions. It enables calling the correct function at runtime based on the object type, even when accessed through a base class pointer.

Both types of polymorphism are essential in C++ and other OOP languages to achieve flexibility and extensibility in code.

Certainly! Let's break down each concept one by one with code examples and detailed explanations. Weâ€™ll go through **Polymorphism**, **Function Overloading**, **Static Casting**, **Virtual Functions**, **Overrides**, and **Downcasting**.

---

### **1. Polymorphism**

**Polymorphism** in C++ allows methods to be used interchangeably by different classes. It provides the ability to call derived class methods using a base class pointer or reference, and the appropriate method will be called based on the object type at runtime.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { // Virtual function allows polymorphism
        cout << "Some generic animal sound!" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { // Overriding base class function
        cout << "Bark!" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { // Overriding base class function
        cout << "Meow!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animal;
    
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;
    
    // Demonstrating polymorphism
    animal = &dog;
    animal->sound();  // Will call Dog's sound()

    animal = &cat;
    animal->sound();  // Will call Cat's sound()

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Polymorphism**: `sound()` is virtual in the `Animal` class, which allows it to be overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes.
- At runtime, the appropriate `sound()` method is called based on the object type (either `Dog` or `Cat`).

**Output:**
```
Bark!
Meow!
```

---

### **2. Function Overloading**

**Function overloading** allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists (either different types or number of parameters). The compiler distinguishes between them based on the function signature.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) {
        cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
    }

    void show(double d) {
        cout << "Double: " << d << endl;
    }

    void show(const string& s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print p;

    p.show(10);        // Calls show(int)
    p.show(3.14);      // Calls show(double)
    p.show("Hello");   // Calls show(string)

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `show` function is overloaded three times: once for an integer, once for a double, and once for a string.
- Depending on the argument type, the correct version of `show` is called.

**Output:**
```
Integer: 10
Double: 3.14
String: Hello
```

---

### **3. Static Casting**

**Static casting** is a compile-time cast used for converting between types. It's safe and checked at compile time, but it can result in undefined behavior if you're casting incompatible types.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double d = 9.8;
    int i = static_cast<int>(d);  // Static cast from double to int

    cout << "Double: " << d << endl;
    cout << "Integer after static_cast: " << i << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `static_cast<int>(d)` converts a `double` to `int`. The decimal part is discarded during the conversion.

**Output:**
```
Double: 9.8
Integer after static_cast: 9
```

---

### **4. Virtual Functions**

A **virtual function** is a member function in the base class that you expect to be overridden in derived classes. When called using a base class pointer, it invokes the derived class's version of the function, enabling **polymorphism**.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() {  // Virtual function
        cout << "Base display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override {  // Overriding base function
        cout << "Derived display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* b;
    Derived d;
    
    b = &d;
    b->display();  // Calls Derived's display()

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `display()` is a virtual function in the `Base` class, which is overridden in the `Derived` class.
- The `b->display()` call invokes the overridden function from `Derived`, not `Base`.

**Output:**
```
Derived display
```

---

### **5. Function Overrides**

When you **override** a function in a derived class, it means you provide a new implementation of a base class's virtual function. The base class function will still exist, but the derived class version will be used if the object is of the derived type.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing a generic shape" << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {  // Function override
        cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s;
    Circle c;
    
    s = &c;
    s->draw();  // Calls Circle's draw() function due to override

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `draw()` is overridden in the `Circle` class, so when called via the base class pointer `s`, the `Circle` version is executed.

**Output:**
```
Drawing a Circle
```

---

### **6. Downcasting**

**Downcasting** refers to casting a pointer or reference to a derived type from a base type. It is often done using `dynamic_cast` when working with polymorphism. If the cast is not valid, `dynamic_cast` returns `nullptr`.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived(); // Base pointer pointing to a Derived object
    Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr);  // Downcasting
    
    if (derivedPtr) {
        derivedPtr->show();  // Successfully downcasted, calls Derived's show()
    } else {
        cout << "Downcasting failed!" << endl;
    }

    delete basePtr;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- A `Base*` pointer is pointing to a `Derived` object.
- Using `dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr)` safely downcasts the pointer to `Derived*`, allowing access to the `Derived` class methods.
- If the cast is unsuccessful, `dynamic_cast` returns `nullptr`, but in this case, it's valid, so `show()` from `Derived` is called.

**Output:**
```
Derived class
```

---

### **Summary:**

1. **Polymorphism**: Allows base class pointers to invoke derived class methods.
2. **Function Overloading**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
3. **Static Casting**: A compile-time casting method for type conversion.
4. **Virtual Functions**: Methods in base classes that can be overridden in derived classes for polymorphism.
5. **Overrides**: Redefining base class virtual functions in the derived class.
6. **Downcasting**: Safely converting a base class pointer/reference to a derived class pointer/reference using `dynamic_cast`.
