Here are some basic probability interview questions, along with brief explanations of what each question is testing. These can help assess a candidate's understanding of fundamental probability concepts:

### 1. **What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting heads?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the candidate's understanding of basic probability principles. For a fair coin, the probability of heads is \( \frac{1}{2} \), as there are two equally likely outcomes (heads or tails).

### 2. **If you roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling a 3?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks the candidate's understanding of simple events and how to calculate probability. The probability of rolling a 3 is \( \frac{1}{6} \), since there are six equally likely outcomes.

### 3. **What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This question assesses knowledge of a standard deck of cards. Half of the 52 cards are red (26 red cards: 13 hearts and 13 diamonds), so the probability is \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### 4. **What is the probability of drawing a heart from a standard deck of 52 cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the understanding of card probability. There are 13 hearts in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a heart is \( \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} \).

### 5. **If you roll two fair dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 7?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of combined probabilities and the number of possible outcomes. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice (6 sides on each die). The following pairs result in a sum of 7: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1) — 6 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \).

### 6. **What is the probability of rolling an even number on a fair six-sided die?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the candidate's ability to identify favorable outcomes. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6, making the probability \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### 7. **If you pick a card at random from a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability that it is either a king or a queen?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the candidate’s knowledge of the addition rule for probabilities. There are 4 kings and 4 queens in the deck, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 8. Thus, the probability is \( \frac{8}{52} = \frac{2}{13} \).

### 8. **What is the probability of drawing two red cards in a row from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests understanding of conditional probability. The probability of drawing the first red card is \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \). After drawing one red card, there are 25 red cards left out of 51 total cards. So, the probability of drawing a second red card is \( \frac{25}{51} \). Therefore, the combined probability is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{52} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{25}{102}
     \]

### 9. **What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4 when rolling a fair six-sided die?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks the candidate's ability to identify favorable outcomes. The numbers greater than 4 on a six-sided die are 5 and 6, so there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6. The probability is \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \).

### 10. **If two fair dice are rolled, what is the probability that the sum is either 2 or 12?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of outcomes with multiple conditions. There is only one way to get a sum of 2 (1 + 1) and one way to get a sum of 12 (6 + 6). So, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 36, resulting in a probability of \( \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18} \).

### 11. **What is the probability of drawing a black card from a deck of 52 playing cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks knowledge of card deck properties. There are 26 black cards (13 spades and 13 clubs) in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability is \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### 12. **A bag contains 3 red balls, 5 green balls, and 2 blue balls. If a ball is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is not green?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests understanding of complementary events. The total number of balls is \( 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 \). The probability of drawing a green ball is \( \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \), so the probability of not drawing a green ball is \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### 13. **If you toss a fair coin 3 times, what is the probability of getting exactly two heads?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of binomial probability. The possible outcomes of 3 coin tosses are \( 2^3 = 8 \). The outcomes with exactly two heads are: HHT, HTH, and THH — 3 favorable outcomes. The probability is \( \frac{3}{8} \).

### 14. **If a card is drawn at random from a standard deck of cards, what is the probability that the card is a face card (jack, queen, or king)?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of the composition of a deck. There are 12 face cards (4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings) in a deck of 52 cards. The probability is \( \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13} \).

### 15. **What is the probability of drawing a card that is either a heart or a queen from a standard deck of cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of the addition rule for probabilities. There are 13 hearts, and there are 4 queens, but one of the queens is also a heart, so we subtract that overlap. The total favorable outcomes are \( 13 + 3 = 16 \). Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13} \).

These questions assess foundational concepts in probability, such as simple events, conditional probability, and combinations of independent events.

Sure! Here are **additional basic probability interview questions**, with varying difficulty levels to cover a broader range of fundamental concepts.

### 16. **What is the probability of rolling a 2 or a 4 on a fair six-sided die?**
   - **Explanation**: This question tests the candidate's ability to calculate probabilities for multiple events. The outcomes 2 and 4 are favorable, so there are 2 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes is 6, so the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{2 or 4}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

### 17. **In a deck of cards, what is the probability of drawing a queen or a red card?**
   - **Explanation**: This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the addition rule. There are 4 queens in a deck, and 26 red cards. However, the 2 red queens (queen of hearts and queen of diamonds) are counted twice, so we need to subtract 2 from the total. The total number of favorable outcomes is:
     \[
     P(\text{queen or red}) = 4 (\text{queens}) + 26 (\text{red cards}) - 2 (\text{red queens}) = 28
     \]
     Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{queen or red}) = \frac{28}{52} = \frac{7}{13}
     \]

### 18. **If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, what is the probability of getting the same number on both rolls?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the candidate's understanding of independent events. The probability of rolling any specific number on the first roll is \( \frac{1}{6} \). For the second roll, the probability of rolling the same number as the first roll is also \( \frac{1}{6} \). Therefore, the probability of getting the same number on both rolls is:
     \[
     P(\text{same number on both rolls}) = \frac{1}{6}
     \]

### 19. **If a fair coin is tossed three times, what is the probability of getting at least one tail?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks the understanding of complementary events. The only outcome where no tails appear is getting heads on all three tosses (HHH). The probability of getting three heads is \( \frac{1}{8} \). Therefore, the probability of getting at least one tail is:
     \[
     P(\text{at least one tail}) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
     \]

### 20. **If two cards are drawn at random without replacement from a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability that both cards are aces?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests understanding of conditional probability and without-replacement scenarios. The probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is \( \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \). After drawing one ace, there are 3 aces left out of 51 cards. The probability of drawing a second ace is \( \frac{3}{51} \). Therefore, the probability of drawing two aces is:
     \[
     P(\text{two aces}) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{12}{2652} = \frac{1}{221}
     \]

### 21. **A box contains 5 red balls, 4 green balls, and 3 blue balls. If one ball is drawn at random, what is the probability that the ball is either red or green?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests understanding of addition rule. There are 5 red balls and 4 green balls, for a total of 9 favorable outcomes out of 12 balls. The probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{red or green}) = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}
     \]

### 22. **What is the probability of drawing an Ace or a Spade from a deck of 52 cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of the addition rule and overlap between events. There are 4 aces and 13 spades in the deck, but the Ace of Spades is counted twice. Therefore, the total favorable outcomes are:
     \[
     P(\text{Ace or Spade}) = 4 (\text{Aces}) + 13 (\text{Spades}) - 1 (\text{Ace of Spades}) = 16
     \]
     The probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ace or Spade}) = \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}
     \]

### 23. **If you roll a fair die twice, what is the probability that the sum is 5?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests the candidate's ability to count favorable outcomes. The possible pairs of dice rolls that sum to 5 are: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 1), so there are 4 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{sum of 5}) = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}
     \]

### 24. **What is the probability of drawing a card that is either a face card or a red card from a deck of 52 cards?**
   - **Explanation**: This is another application of the addition rule. There are 12 face cards (4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings) and 26 red cards (13 hearts + 13 diamonds). However, the 6 red face cards (jack, queen, king of hearts and diamonds) are counted twice, so we subtract 6. The total number of favorable outcomes is:
     \[
     P(\text{face card or red}) = 12 (\text{face cards}) + 26 (\text{red cards}) - 6 (\text{red face cards}) = 32
     \]
     The probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{face card or red}) = \frac{32}{52} = \frac{8}{13}
     \]

### 25. **A bag contains 4 red marbles, 3 green marbles, and 2 blue marbles. If two marbles are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that both marbles are blue?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of conditional probability without replacement. The probability of drawing a blue marble on the first draw is \( \frac{2}{9} \). After drawing one blue marble, there is 1 blue marble left out of 8 total marbles. The probability of drawing the second blue marble is \( \frac{1}{8} \). Therefore, the probability of drawing two blue marbles is:
     \[
     P(\text{two blue}) = \frac{2}{9} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{72} = \frac{1}{36}
     \]

### 26. **What is the probability of drawing a prime number from the numbers 1 through 10?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks the ability to identify favorable outcomes from a given set. The prime numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, there are 4 favorable outcomes. The probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{prime number}) = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]

### 27. **If a fair die is rolled twice, what is the probability that the first roll is a 3 and the second roll is a number greater than 4?**
   - **Explanation**: This tests knowledge of independent events. The probability of rolling a 3 on the first roll is \( \frac{1}{6} \). The numbers greater than 4 on a six-sided die are 5 and 6, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on the second roll is \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \). The combined probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{first roll 3 and second roll > 4}) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{18}
     \]

### 28. **What is the probability of drawing a number greater than 7 from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}?**
   - **Explanation**: This checks basic understanding of outcomes. The numbers greater than 7 are 8, 9, and 10, so there are 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes is 10. Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 7}) = \frac{3}{10}
     \]

These additional questions cover a broad range of foundational probability concepts and test the ability to apply basic rules (like the addition rule, multiplication rule, and complement rule) in various scenarios.
