Here's an advanced SQL interview exercise that covers multiple concepts, including complex joins, subqueries, window functions, aggregation, and optimization techniques. The problem is designed to test your ability to handle a wide range of SQL scenarios.

### Problem: Sales Analysis and Reporting

**Background:**

You are given the following tables:

1. **`Customers`**
   - `customer_id` (INT)
   - `customer_name` (VARCHAR)
   - `join_date` (DATE)
   - `country` (VARCHAR)

2. **`Products`**
   - `product_id` (INT)
   - `product_name` (VARCHAR)
   - `category` (VARCHAR)
   - `price` (DECIMAL)

3. **`Orders`**
   - `order_id` (INT)
   - `customer_id` (INT)
   - `order_date` (DATE)
   - `total_amount` (DECIMAL)

4. **`Order_Items`**
   - `order_item_id` (INT)
   - `order_id` (INT)
   - `product_id` (INT)
   - `quantity` (INT)
   - `price_at_purchase` (DECIMAL)

---

### Requirements:

1. **Customer's Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
   Write a query to calculate the total lifetime value (LTV) of each customer. LTV is the total amount spent by the customer across all their orders.

2. **Top 5 Customers by LTV**:
   Write a query to return the top 5 customers by lifetime value, including their `customer_name`, `LTV`, and the `country` they are from. Sort the results in descending order of LTV.

3. **Monthly Revenue Trend**:
   Write a query to show the total revenue for each month, ordered by the month and year. Include the `month_year` (formatted as `YYYY-MM`), and total revenue for that month.

4. **Products with the Highest Revenue**:
   Write a query to identify the top 5 products by revenue. For each product, return the `product_name`, `category`, and the total revenue generated by the product. The revenue should be the sum of `(price_at_purchase * quantity)` for all orders where that product was purchased.

5. **Yearly Growth in Revenue**:
   Calculate the year-over-year revenue growth percentage. Return the year, total revenue for that year, and the percentage change from the previous year (if applicable). Ensure that the first year shows `NULL` for the percentage change.

6. **Average Order Value (AOV) by Country**:
   Write a query to calculate the average order value by country. Include the `country` and the average order value for each country. Order the result by the average order value in descending order.

7. **Top 3 Selling Products by Region**:
   Write a query to find the top 3 selling products in each country. Return the `country`, `product_name`, `category`, and the total quantity sold for each product. For each country, only the top 3 products by quantity should be returned.

### Tips for Solving:
- For **LTV**, you can join the `Orders` and `Order_Items` tables to calculate the total spent by each customer.
- To calculate **monthly revenue**, you might need to extract the month and year from the `order_date` and group by that.
- For **revenue by product**, use `JOIN` between `Order_Items` and `Products` to calculate the total revenue for each product.
- For **year-over-year growth**, use window functions (`LAG`) to get the revenue for the previous year and calculate the growth.
- **Top N products by region** could be solved using `ROW_NUMBER()` and `PARTITION BY` for each country.

### Advanced SQL Techniques to Use:
- **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, and `RANK()`.
- **Aggregation**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, and grouping by date or other fields.
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN to combine multiple tables.
- **Subqueries**: For filtering or complex calculations.
- **Date Functions**: `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DATE_FORMAT()` for formatting and extracting parts of dates.

Feel free to attempt solving this, and I can help guide you through any parts you're having trouble with!

### Exercise Solutions:

#### 1. **Customer's Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
The lifetime value (LTV) is the total amount spent by a customer across all their orders.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_purchase) AS lifetime_value
FROM
    Customers c
JOIN
    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN
    Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY
    lifetime_value DESC;
```

- **Explanation**: This query joins the `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Order_Items` tables to calculate the total amount spent by each customer. The `SUM()` function is used to aggregate the total spent on all their orders.

---

#### 2. **Top 5 Customers by LTV**:
Find the top 5 customers by lifetime value, including their `customer_name`, `LTV`, and `country`.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_purchase) AS lifetime_value,
    c.country
FROM
    Customers c
JOIN
    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN
    Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_name, c.country
ORDER BY
    lifetime_value DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- **Explanation**: This query is similar to the first one but limits the result to the top 5 customers based on their lifetime value. The `LIMIT` clause ensures that only the top 5 customers are returned.

---

#### 3. **Monthly Revenue Trend**:
Calculate the total revenue for each month, ordered by the month and year.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month_year,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_purchase) AS total_revenue
FROM
    Orders o
JOIN
    Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY
    month_year
ORDER BY
    month_year;
```

- **Explanation**: The `DATE_FORMAT()` function is used to extract the `YYYY-MM` format from the `order_date` field. Then we group by `month_year` and calculate the total revenue for each month using `SUM()`.

---

#### 4. **Products with the Highest Revenue**:
Identify the top 5 products by revenue, returning their `product_name`, `category`, and total revenue.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_purchase) AS total_revenue
FROM
    Products p
JOIN
    Order_Items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.product_name, p.category
ORDER BY
    total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- **Explanation**: We join `Products` with `Order_Items` to calculate the total revenue for each product. The `SUM()` function is used to aggregate revenue, and the `LIMIT` clause returns the top 5 products by revenue.

---

#### 5. **Yearly Growth in Revenue**:
Calculate the year-over-year revenue growth percentage.

**Solution:**
```sql
WITH YearlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(o.order_date) AS year,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_purchase) AS total_revenue
    FROM
        Orders o
    JOIN
        Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    GROUP BY
        year
)
SELECT
    year,
    total_revenue,
    LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_revenue,
    CASE
        WHEN LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year) IS NULL THEN NULL
        ELSE ((total_revenue - LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year)) / LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY year)) * 100
    END AS revenue_growth_percentage
FROM
    YearlyRevenue
ORDER BY
    year;
```

- **Explanation**: This query uses a common table expression (CTE) to first calculate the total revenue for each year. Then, the `LAG()` window function is used to get the revenue of the previous year for each row. The percentage growth is calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{{growth\_percentage}} = \frac{{\text{{current\_revenue}} - \text{{previous\_revenue}}}}{{\text{{previous\_revenue}}}} \times 100
  \]
  If the previous year's revenue is `NULL` (i.e., for the first year), the percentage growth is also `NULL`.

---

#### 6. **Average Order Value (AOV) by Country**:
Calculate the average order value by country.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
    c.country,
    AVG(o.total_amount) AS average_order_value
FROM
    Customers c
JOIN
    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.country
ORDER BY
    average_order_value DESC;
```

- **Explanation**: We calculate the average order value (`AVG(total_amount)`) for each country by joining the `Customers` and `Orders` tables. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the calculation is done per country.

---

#### 7. **Top 3 Selling Products by Region**:
Find the top 3 selling products by country, showing `country`, `product_name`, `category`, and the total quantity sold for each product.

**Solution:**
```sql
WITH ProductSales AS (
    SELECT
        c.country,
        p.product_name,
        p.category,
        SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
    FROM
        Customers c
    JOIN
        Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN
        Order_Items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN
        Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY
        c.country, p.product_name, p.category
)
SELECT
    country,
    product_name,
    category,
    total_quantity_sold
FROM (
    SELECT
        country,
        product_name,
        category,
        total_quantity_sold,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC) AS row_num
    FROM
        ProductSales
) AS ranked
WHERE
    row_num <= 3
ORDER BY
    country, total_quantity_sold DESC;
```

- **Explanation**: We use a CTE (`ProductSales`) to calculate the total quantity sold per product in each country. The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function assigns a rank to each product within each country, ordered by the total quantity sold. The outer query filters to return only the top 3 products for each country.

---

### Summary:
These solutions cover a variety of advanced SQL techniques such as:
- **Aggregation** (`SUM()`, `AVG()`)
- **Joins** (`JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`)
- **Window functions** (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`)
- **Subqueries and CTEs** for complex aggregations
- **Date functions** for extracting year/month information
- **Ranking** with `ROW_NUMBER()` for top N queries
